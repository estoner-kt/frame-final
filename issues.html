<!--
1. footer covers the content 
2. slideshow on mobile looks very small, while it spans 100% on the desktop view (maybe it is not designed for header)
3. Striped Table missing color
4. Submenu is not working on mobile
5. grid doesn't have breakpoints - content shrinks, col-4 +col-4 +col-4 stays the same as on desktop, instead of spans 100%.
